## üì¶ Overview

MoonTV is a simple movie player designed for everyone. It's a front-end application that you can host as a static site. You don't need Node.js or a server database. MoonTV works well with platforms that allow only static file hosting, like EdgeOne Pages.

### ‚ú® Key Features
- **Static Export**: The application builds output to the `out/` folder for easy deployment.
- **Front-End Data Flow**: Direct browser requests pull data from third-party sources for searches, details, and more.
- **Global Password**: Access control is managed through a single login for various pages including the homepage and admin section.
- **Local Storage**: Save your playback history, favorites, search history, and other settings right in your browser.
- **Proxy Configuration**: Use `config.json` to set up proxies for handling CORS issues.
- **Ad-Free**: No advertisements will disrupt your viewing experience.
- **PWA Disabled**: Service workers are turned off to avoid issues with static exports.
